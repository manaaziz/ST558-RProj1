# Required Packages

For this project, I needed to use a variety of really amazing R
packages:

  - `knitr`: for creating pretty tables using the `kable()` function.  
  - `tidyverse`: for data manipulation, plot generation (via `ggplot2`),
    and piping/chaining.  
  - `gridExtra`: to stitch ggplots into a grid.  
  - `rmarkdown`: to knit output files manually using the `render()`
    function.  
  - `jsonlite`: for pulling data from the various endpoints of the NHL
    APIs.

# Creating the Functions

The first thing that I did was create three functions:

1.  `getRecords()`: this function takes in an endpoint and team ID (or
    name) from the NHL Records API and queries the correct data set.  
2.  `getStats()`: this function takes in an optional modifier argument
    and queries the correct data set from the NHL Stats API.  
3.  `pullData()`: this function is a wrapper function for `getRecords()`
    and `getStats()`. It serves as a one-stop-shop for the user to
    access any of the endpoints from above APIs.

``` r
# Write URL to access the NHL Records API
getRecords <- function(endpoint, teamID = NULL, teamName = NULL){
  base <- "https://records.nhl.com/site/api"
  table <- endpoint
  if (!is.null(teamName) & is.null(teamID)) {
    full_url <- full_url <- paste0(base, "/", table)
    data <- fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$data %>% filter(franchiseName == teamName)
  } else if(!is.null(teamID) & is.null(teamName)) {
      full_url <- paste0(base, "/", table, "?cayenneExp=franchiseId=", teamID)
      data <-fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$data
  } else if(is.null(teamID) & is.null(teamName)) {
      full_url <- paste0(base, "/", table)
      data <-fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$data
    }
  return(data)
}


# Write the function for the NHL Stats API
getStats <- function(modifier, teamID = NULL, season=NULL){
  base <- "https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams"
  if(!is.null(modifier)){
    if (modifier == "team.roster"){
      full_url <- paste0(base, "/", teamID, "?expand=", modifier)
      data <- fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$teams[[30]][[1]]
    } else if(modifier == "team.schedule.next" | modifier == "team.schedule.previous"){
      full_url <- paste0(base, "/", teamID, "?expand=", modifier)
      data <- fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$teams[[34]][[1]]
    } else if (modifier == "team.stats"){
      full_url <- paste0(base, "/", teamID, "?expand=", modifier)
      data <- fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$teams[[8]][[1]]
      data <- data[[1]][[1]]
    } else if (modifier == "statsSingleSeasonPlayoffs"){
      full_url <- paste0(base, "/", teamID, "?stats=", modifier)
      data <- fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$teams
    } else if (!is.null(season)){
      full_url <- paste0(base, "/", teamID, "?expand=", modifier, "&season=", season)
      data <- fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$teams
    } else {
        full_url <- paste0(base, "/", teamID, "?expand=", modifier)
        data <- fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$teams
      }
  }
  if (is.null(modifier)){
    full_url <- base
    data <- fromJSON(full_url, flatten = TRUE)$teams
  }
  return(data)
}

# Write the wrapper function
pullData <- function(api = c("stats", "records"), endpoint = NULL, 
                     teamName = NULL, teamID = NULL, modifier = NULL,
                     season = NULL){
  if(api == "stats"){
    data <- getStats(modifier = modifier, teamID = teamID, season = season)
    }
  if(api == "records"){
    data <- getRecords(endpoint = endpoint, teamID  = teamID, teamName = teamName)
    }
  return(data)
}
```

# Creating a Nice Data Set

As a Las Vegas native, I really wanted to do something with Vegas Golden
Knights (VGK), so I pulled the 2017/2018 Vegas Golden Knights roster
from the `roster` endpoint. Then, since I knew exactly what I wanted in
my data, I created two loops to pull two data sets about the players out
of the `players` endpoint in the NHL Stats API.

``` r
# read in the roster of the VGK for the 2017/2018 season
rosters <- pullData(api = "stats", modifier = "team.roster", teamID = 54, season = 20172018)
VGKrost <- as.data.frame(rosters)
VGKrost <- VGKrost %>% filter(position.code != "G") %>% select(-person.link)

# Get the stats for each individual player.
ppl <- VGKrost$person.id %>% as.vector(mode = "character")
temp <- data.frame()
df.stats <- data.frame()
for (i in 1:length(ppl)){
  url <- paste0("https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/people/", ppl[i],
                "/stats?stats=statsSingleSeason&season=20172018")
  temp <- fromJSON(url, flatten = TRUE)$stats$splits[[1]]
  temp$person.id <- as.numeric(ppl[i])
  df.stats <- bind_rows(df.stats, temp)
}

# Get more stats for each individual player.
ppl <- VGKrost$person.id %>% as.vector(mode = "character")
temp <- data.frame()
df.ppl <- data.frame()
for (i in 1:length(ppl)){
  url <- paste0("https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/people/", ppl[i])
  temp <- fromJSON(url, flatten = TRUE)$people %>% as.data.frame()
  df.ppl <- bind_rows(df.ppl, temp)
}
```

# Data Manipulation

To get the data to the form that I wanted, I first had to use an inner
join to match-merge the data sets by player ID. The only problem was
that there were a bunch of redundant columns or just columns that I knew
I didnâ€™t need, so I went ahead and removed them. After that, I went
ahead and created some new variables.

``` r
# Join the three data sets
df.ppl <- df.ppl %>% rename(person.id = id)
dfd <- inner_join(VGKrost, df.ppl, by = "person.id")
df <- inner_join(dfd, df.stats)

# Get rid of redundant rows
df <- df %>% select(-ends_with("link"), -starts_with("primary"), -ends_with("TimeOnIce"), 
                    -position.code, -person.fullName, -firstName, -lastName, -active,
                    -starts_with("birth"), -rosterStatus, -currentTeam.name, 
                    -currentTeam.id, -season, -ends_with("TimeOnIcePerGame")) %>%
             filter(!is.na(stat.games))


# Create new variables
df <- df %>% mutate(domHand = ifelse(shootsCatches=="L", "Left", "Right")) %>% select(-shootsCatches)
df <- df %>% mutate(goalsPerGame = stat.goals/stat.games, 
                    assistsPerGame = stat.assists/stat.games,
                    shotsPerGame = stat.shots/stat.games,
                    hitsPerGame = stat.hits/stat.games) 
```

# Contingency Tables

I created some tables for the categorical variables that I had in my
data set. I was able to see the breakdown of positions, nationalities,
and dominant hands on the team.

``` r
# Create contingency tables
table(df$position.name) %>% kable(caption = "Number of players in each field position", 
                                  col.names = c("Position", "Frequency"))
```

| Position   | Frequency |
| :--------- | --------: |
| Center     |         7 |
| Defenseman |         8 |
| Left Wing  |         3 |
| Right Wing |         4 |

Number of players in each field position

``` r
table(df$nationality) %>% kable(caption = "Number of Players by Nationality",
                                col.names = c("Nationality", "Frequency"))
```

| Nationality | Frequency |
| :---------- | --------: |
| CAN         |        14 |
| CZE         |         1 |
| SWE         |         1 |
| USA         |         6 |

Number of Players by Nationality

``` r
table(df$position.name, df$domHand) %>% kable(caption = "Player Position by Dominant Hand",
                                                    col.names = c("Left-Handed", "Right-Handed"))
```

|            | Left-Handed | Right-Handed |
| :--------- | ----------: | -----------: |
| Center     |           5 |            2 |
| Defenseman |           6 |            2 |
| Left Wing  |           3 |            0 |
| Right Wing |           1 |            3 |

Player Position by Dominant Hand

# Quantitative Summaries

I then created some tables for the mean goals, assists, shots, and hits
for the different nationalities and positions. I also created a table
that displays the estimated mean and standard error of the amount of
goals scored by dominant hand to get an idea to whether or not there was
a significant difference.

``` r
# Make the first contingency table: average measurements by position
means1 <- df %>% group_by(position.name) %>% summarize(avgGoals = mean(stat.goals, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                                       avgAssists = mean(stat.assists, na.rm = TRUE),
                                                       avgShots = mean(stat.shots, na.rm = TRUE),
                                                       avgHits = mean(stat.hits, na.rm = TRUE))
means1 %>% kable(caption = "Average Season Stats by Position",
                 col.names = c("Position", "Goals", "Assists", "Shots", "Hits"))
```

| Position   |     Goals |  Assists |    Shots |      Hits |
| :--------- | --------: | -------: | -------: | --------: |
| Center     | 15.285714 | 19.85714 | 111.1429 |  48.14286 |
| Defenseman |  4.375000 | 14.12500 |  83.0000 |  86.50000 |
| Left Wing  |  8.333333 | 10.00000 | 118.6667 |  94.66667 |
| Right Wing | 15.250000 | 27.00000 | 126.7500 | 107.00000 |

Average Season Stats by Position

``` r
# Make the second contingency table: average measurements by nationality
means2 <- df %>% filter(nationality %in% c("CAN", "CHE", "USA", "SWE")) %>%
                 group_by(nationality) %>%
                 summarise(avgGoals = mean(stat.goals, na.rm = TRUE), 
                           avgAssists = mean(stat.assists, na.rm = TRUE),
                           avgShots = mean(stat.shots, na.rm = TRUE),
                           avgHits = mean(stat.hits, na.rm = TRUE))
means2 %>% kable(caption = "Average Stats for Selected Players Nationalities",
                 col.names = c("Nationality", "Goals", "Assists", "Shots", "Hits"))
```

| Nationality |     Goals |  Assists |     Shots |     Hits |
| :---------- | --------: | -------: | --------: | -------: |
| CAN         |  8.214286 | 15.64286 |  88.78571 | 86.00000 |
| SWE         | 43.000000 | 35.00000 | 184.00000 | 48.00000 |
| USA         | 10.500000 | 21.33333 | 131.00000 | 72.66667 |

Average Stats for Selected Players Nationalities

``` r
# Make the third contingency table: mean & sd by dominant hand
means3 <- df %>% group_by(domHand) %>% summarise(avgGoals = round(mean(stat.goals, na.rm = TRUE), 3), 
                                                 sdGoals = round(sd(stat.goals, na.rm = TRUE), 3))
means3 %>% kable(caption = "Average Goals (and SE) by Players Handedness",
                 col.names = c("Dominant Hand", "Mean", "Std. Dev."))
```

| Dominant Hand |   Mean | Std. Dev. |
| :------------ | -----: | --------: |
| Left          | 10.467 |    10.882 |
| Right         | 10.143 |    10.605 |

Average Goals (and SE) by Players Handedness

# Plots

I stitched the four required plots (boxplot, histogram, scatterplot, and
barplot) together in a grid. They help visualize different
characteristics of the data.

``` r
# Create the required plots
plot1 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = position.name, fill = domHand)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
           labs(x = "Position Name", y = "Count", title = "Field Positions by Dominant Hand") + 
           scale_fill_manual(values = c("#a8ddb5", "#43a2ca"), name = "Dominant Hand") + 
           theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
plot2 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = stat.shots, y = stat.goals, color = domHand)) + 
           geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values = c("#fdb462", "#80b1d3"), name = "Dominant Hand") +
           labs(x = "Season Shots", y = "Season Goals", title = "Shots Taken vs. Goals Scored")
plot3 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = position.name, y = stat.assists)) + 
           geom_boxplot(color = "#225ea8") +
           stat_summary(fun = mean, geom="line", group= 1, color= "#a6cee3", size = 1.5) +
           labs(x = "Position Name", y = "Season Assists", title = "Season Assists by Position")
plot4 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x=hitsPerGame)) + 
           geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1/3, color = "black") +
           labs(x = "Hits Per Game", y = "Density", title = "Distribution of Hits per Game") + 
           stat_density(geom = "line", adjust = .55, lwd = 2, color = "#CC0000")
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, nrow = 2)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/plotz-1.png)<!-- -->

Then, I created another plot to show the the distribution of the goals
scored by dominant hand.

``` r
plot5 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = stat.goals)) + 
           geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 10) +
           stat_density(geom = "line", adjust = 1, lwd = 2, color = "#CC0000") + facet_wrap(~domHand) +
           labs(y = "Density", x = "Season Goals Scored", 
                title = "Distribution of Goals Scored by Dominant Hand")
plot5
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/plot5-1.png)<!-- -->

Finally, I wanted to further investigate the relationship between season
shots taken and goals scored. I created a scatter plot and overlaid a
linear regression line.

``` r
plot6  <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = stat.shots, y = stat.goals)) + 
            geom_point(color = "#CC0000") + annotate(geom = "text", x = 50, y = 35, label = eq) +
            geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y ~ x + I(x^2), se= FALSE, lty = 2, color = "#4daf4a") +
            labs(x = "Season Shots", y = "Season Goals", title = "Shots Taken vs. Goals Scored")
plot6
```
